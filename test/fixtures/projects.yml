  description: The Nintendo Wii is marketed as a next-generation gaming system, but we also saw potential for it to be used for collaborative work.  We analyzed various aspects of the system, from its interaction controls to its user interface to its use of avatars to see how easily users can achieve the state of &quot;flow&quot; as described by (Csikszentmihalyi, 1998)

  name: Analysis of MichiPoster.com
  description: "MichiPoster.com was an interactive public-display system developed by fellow SIer Joshua Palay for the purpose of displaying information relevant to the SI community.  Even though the system has a target audience, MichiPoster.com is still by definition a pure public good and is susceptible to the same problems - most notably, free riding.

    At the time of analysis, MichiPoster was still in its nascent stages, having been up for less than a year and in the process of adding a new display in SI's North campus.  MichiPoster therefore allowed me to track the effects of changes to the system and analyze its effectiveness in integrating with the lives and habits of the people of the School of Information.

    By analyzing the data produced by Google Analytics, it was found to also be susceptible to the free-rider problem.  Specific recommendations on how to alleviate the issue, however, could not be given because the privacy-orientated nature of SI's community prevented accurate and detailed usage patterns from being collected by Google Analytics (most everybody disabled cookies from MichiPoster)"

To achieve this, I also conducted comparative analysis of competitor products such as Microsoft's Visual Studio and OmniGraffle and modeled a typical application development workflow based on Apple's Cocoa (Objective-C) and RubyCocoa tutorials."

  description: "I designed a 40-question survey regarding user experience and satisfaction with several applications in Apple's Xcode Developer Tools suite.  The survey's major goals were: 1) to find out whether or not Apple's core customers had evolved over the years; 2) whether or not users' mental models of specific features matched those of the development team; 3) to find out the level of satisfaction with their tools; and finally, 4) to make the survey short enough that it can be completed by attendees at WWDC.  The survey, however, was not deployed or conducted."

Outliers were culled (some files had thousands of lines of code while others had less than 100) and normalized.  "

  name: Privacy Filter
  description: "I developed a simple 2-step content-filtration system using a combination of bluetooth detection and AttentionMeter to control the type and scope of information that is displayed.  In short, I made a privacy filter for Ben's public display.

    In the first step, the system takes as input the identities, distances of people from the display, attention level of people interacting with the display.  For each person, I assign   one of four &quot;phases of interaction&quot;, as described by (Vogel et al, 2004): ambient, implicit, subtle, and personal.  I split the last phase, personal interaction, into group interaction (more than one person interacting) and personal (a single person interacting).

    In the second step, each individual's context is taken into account to filter out information that is inappropriate for the current context.  For example, calendar event details for an individual far away from the system should not be displayed, but details for someone looking directly at the display should be shown.

    You can read more detail about my system at Ben's &lt;a href='http://situated.wordpress.com/proposals/'&gt;Situation Interactions Blog&lt;/a&gt;"

  name: Xcode Message Bubbles Redesign
  description: "One of Xcode's newest features were message bubbles: the ability to display various types of information (compilation errors, conditional breakpoints, etc.) within the Xcode editor itself.  However, one major issue with message bubbles was that its implementation (as of summer 2008) alters the formatting of the code itself by introducing line breaks.  Working with my manager and one of the DT developers, I conducted contextual inquiries within the department (especially the lead developer of the feature), created lo-fi image prototypes, mid-fi protoypes using Keynote, and hi-fi prototypes written in Cocoa (Objective-C)."
